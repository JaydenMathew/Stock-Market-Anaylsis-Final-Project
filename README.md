# Stock-Market-Analysis-Final-Project

In this Final Project, I explored a CSV datafile containing stock market data between the years of 2008-2023 for: Apple, Amazon, Meta, and Tesla. My analysis aimed to conduct an analysis of stock market presence of these companies and some major aspects of their stock including: relevance, volatility, current market standings, and peaks/valleys in stock price. In order to conduct this analysis, I formed my project on the following questions: 

1. From the years of 2008 to 2023, which company (AAPL, AMZN, TSLA, GOOG) had the highest percent change overall? How about the lowest percent change?
2. What was the average stock price since 2018 for all of the companies?
3. Which company holds the highest volume all time? How about the lowest volume of all time?
4. Since 2008, which date did each company have their highest stock price per share?
5. Which company had the highest change in stock value held in a singular day?

My project was completed on Jupyter Notebooks using pandas and matplotlib (Python programming packages). Aside from my own programming, ChatGPT and Yahoo Finance were utilized. ChatGPT was used to help improve visualization of the data in the outputs, thus improving the understanding of the data. Furthermore, Yahoo Finance was used as a reference to ensure the accuracy of the outputs. 

Contained within this repository includes: 

CSV File: obtained from Kaggle. This CSV file was already cleaned and contained no NaN values. Alterations were minor (fomratting of column names). 
Jupyter Notebook: contains programming code used in the stock market analysis, documentation of code, outputs (tables and charts), conclusions reached, and references. 
Final Project Summary: one page summary of my project. Quick explanation of project idea, process, results, and further intentions with the project. 
Final Project Presentation: professional presentation of my findings and process. Also explains the formation of my idea/background.
